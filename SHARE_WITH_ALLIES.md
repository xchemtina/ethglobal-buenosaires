## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (Copy-Paste Ready)

> "PoX is type-specific peer review for science. Different experiments have different error rates—PXRD 50%, NMR 30%, HPLC 5%—so we built reputation multipliers that reward reviewers proportionally. Find a PXRD error? Earn 3× reputation. This aligns economic incentives with scientific value. Think of it as 'proof-of-stake for science'—your reputation is at stake, and you earn more for finding harder errors."

---

## 💡 Why This Matters (For Your Network)

### For **Academic Researchers**:
"Build on-chain reputation that follows you between institutions. 'Show me your PoX score' becomes the new 'Show me your h-index'."

### For **Journal Editors**:
"Require PoX CIDs in supporting information. First blockchain-verified journal. Reduce retractions, speed up peer review."

### For **Pharma QC**:
"PXRD validation with 3× reputation multiplier attracts expert reviewers. Catch polymorph errors before clinical trials. Save millions."

### For **DeSci Investors**:
"$28B/year problem. Proven traction (25 experiments on-chain). Clear go-to-market (target PXRD first—highest error rate, biggest pain point). Team has domain expertise + execution speed (built V2 in 72 minutes)."

---

## 📊 Key Stats (Memorize These)

- **Problem Size**: $28B/year reproducibility crisis
- **Error Rates**: PXRD 50% > NMR 30% > HPLC 5%
- **Multipliers**: PXRD 3× > NMR 2× > HPLC 1×
- **Economics**: $5.50/hour for NMR reviews (vs. $0 traditional)
- **Traction**: 25 experiments on-chain, live dashboard
- **Network**: Filecoin Calibration testnet, mainnet next week

## 🔗 Who to Connect Us With

### **High Priority**:
1. **Journal editors** at *J. Org. Chem.*, *Acta Cryst.*, *J. Proteome Res.*
2. **Protocol Labs** (Filecoin partnership)
3. **DeSci DAOs**: VitaDAO, ValleyDAO, LabDAO
4. **Pharma QC directors** (especially polymorph specialists)
5. **University analytical chemistry core facilities**

### **Medium Priority**:
6. **NSF program officers** (especially SBIR/STTR)
7. **ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry** leaders
8. **Causality Network** (lab instrument integration)
9. **Crystallography community** (PXRD is our killer use case)

### **Warm Intro Template**:
> "Hey [Name], wanted to introduce you to [Your Name] who's building PoX—blockchain reputation for scientific peer review. They've already got 25 experiments on-chain and are targeting PXRD validation (50% error rate!) as their wedge. Thought you two should connect given your work in [domain]. [Your Name], [Name] is [description]. [Name], here's their pitch doc: [link to JUDGES.md]."

## ❓ FAQs (For When Your Contacts Ask)

**Q: "Is this just crypto hype?"**  
A: "No. Real scientists, real data, real problem. 25 experiments already on-chain. Dashboard is live. No tokens, just reputation."

**Q: "Why would scientists trust blockchain?"**  
A: "They already trust DOIs (also cryptographic hashes). We use scientific terminology ('peer review' not 'fraud proof'). Adoption over purity."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**  
A: "Phase 1: Grants. Phase 2: Marketplace fees (3%). Phase 3: Lab subscriptions ($500/mo enterprise). Public goods layer stays free."

**Q: "How is this different from [ResearchGate/Academia.edu/etc]?"**  
A: "Those are paper-sharing. PoX is data validation with economic incentives. We cryptographically verify experiments, not just host PDFs."

**Q: "Can I try it?"**  
A: "Yes! Testnet live now. Mainnet launches Week 1 post-hackathon. Email [your-email] for early access."

Subject: PoX — Type-Specific Peer Review for Science

Hi [Name],

Quick intro: PoX is blockchain-based reputation for scientific peer review, 
with type-specific multipliers that reward harder problems more.

Key insight: PXRD has 50% error rate, HPLC has 5%. We pay reviewers 3× 
reputation for PXRD, 1× for HPLC. This aligns incentives with reality.

Why it matters:
- $28B/year reproducibility crisis
- Current peer review is unpaid (no incentive to find errors)
- First system that rewards reviewers proportionally to difficulty

Traction:
- 25 experiments on-chain (live testnet)
- Working dashboard: [demo link]
- Targeting pharma QC + crystallography first

Ask: [Specific request based on their role]
- Journals: Pilot program requiring PoX CIDs
- Funders: Grant partnership discussion
- Labs: Beta testing + feedback

Full pitch: [attach JUDGES.md]
Roadmap: [attach PEER_REVIEW_ROADMAP.md]

Happy to jump on a call if this resonates.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Built the V2 system in 72 minutes at 3 AM during ETH Global Buenos 
Aires. Production-ready, not vaporware. 🚀
