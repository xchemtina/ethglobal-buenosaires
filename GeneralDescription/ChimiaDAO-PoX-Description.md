ChimiaDAO: Verifiable Proof-of-Experiment Infrastructure on Filecoin Onchain Cloud

⸻

Project Description

ChimiaDAO is building a next-generation Proof-of-Experiment (PoX) platform for chemistry labs and open science, powered by Filecoin Onchain Cloud. Our system ensures that every chemical synthesis, HPLC/NMR spectrum, and lab-metadata bundle is stored, verified, and monetised in a fully decentralised stack.

Key components:
	1.	Immutable experiment storage — Raw chromatograms, NMR datasets, and IoT environmental sensor logs are content-addressed via IPFS and persisted on Filecoin Onchain Cloud with verifiable on-chain proofs of storage and retrieval.  ￼
	2.	Ownership & traceability — Each experiment generates an NFT (ERC-721/1155 on FEVM) with metadata pointing to the stored data. Laboratories and researchers mint, transfer, or challenge their claims securely.
	3.	Challenge & verification layer — Participants can initiate integrity checks (e.g., “Did impurity exceed threshold?”, “Was retention time consistent?”) and submit verifiable proofs or raw data re-runs.
	4.	Indexing & query — A Graph-powered subgraph exposes the experiment registry, challenge history, and storage status, enabling dashboards, provenance analytics, and reputation signals.
	5.	Incentives & DAU model — Labs earn tokens for uploading high-quality data; verifiers earn rewards for successful challenges; environmental sensor metadata adds a meta-layer of lab-condition logging.

Why Filecoin Onchain Cloud?
Because data integrity and long-term availability are core to scientific credibility, we built on Filecoin’s storage market, on-chain payment rails, and verifiable proofs to guarantee our ecosystem isn’t just “trust us” — it’s “prove yourself”.  ￼

Impact:
• Enables reproducibility: experiment data is permanently stored, retrievable, auditable.
• Lowers barriers: labs worldwide can upload datasets, mint claims, and participate in global verification.
• Cross-discipline potential: While focused on chemistry (HPLC/NMR), the infrastructure supports any scientific dataset, IoT logs, or analytics pipeline.

In short, ChimiaDAO proposes a verifiable, decentralised lab data economy, anchored on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, to rebuild trust and reproducibility in scientific experiments.
