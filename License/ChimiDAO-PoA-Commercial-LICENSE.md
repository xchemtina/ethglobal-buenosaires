1. License Grant

1.1 Non-Production Grant. Subject to the terms of this License, Licensor grants
Licensee a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
worldwide license to:
   (i) Use the Software for Non-Production Use;
   (ii) make Modifications for Licensee’s internal Non-Production Use; and
   (iii) create and store reasonable numbers of copies for backup and archival
         purposes in support of Non-Production Use.

1.2 No Automatic Production Rights. This License does NOT grant any rights for
Production Use. Any Production Use requires a separate written agreement with
Licensor (for example, a commercial or enterprise license). Licensor may grant
or withhold such rights in Licensor’s sole discretion and may condition them on
fees or other terms.

1.3 Fees. The Non-Production Use rights in 1.1 are granted fee-free. Any
rights for Production Use may be subject to fees as agreed in a separate
written contract.

2. Restrictions

2.1 No Redistribution. Except as explicitly permitted in Section 3 (Contribu-
tions), Licensee must not distribute, publish, disclose, sell, sublicense, or
otherwise make the Software or any Modifications available to any third party,
in source or object form, including by hosting a public or shared repository.

2.2 No Hosting as a Service. Licensee must not offer the Software (or
substantial functionality of it) as a service, platform, or feature to any
third party, whether for fee or free, including as part of a SaaS or managed
service, without a separate written agreement with Licensor granting Production
Use rights.

2.3 No Sublicensing or Assignment. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or
transfer this License or any rights under it, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise, without Licensor’s prior written consent. Any attempted
transfer in violation of this Section is void.

2.4 Notices. Licensee must preserve all copyright, license, and attribution
notices included in the Software and in any internal copies or Modifications.

2.5 Third-Party Code. The Software may include or depend on components under
separate open-source or proprietary licenses. Those components are governed by
their own terms; this License does not alter those terms.

2.6 No Circumvention. Licensee must not attempt to circumvent technical or
contractual limitations intended to enforce these restrictions.

3. Contributions and Feedback

3.1 Contributions. If Licensee submits any Contribution to Licensor (for

non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license, with the right to
sublicense, to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, create derivative works of,
